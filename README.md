# Lite8 - Intelligent Street Lighting System

· Lite8 is an adaptive lighting technology that aims to provide energy-efficient street lighting systems.

· Controlled the ’on’ time and intensity of street lights using ultrasonic sensors for detecting motion and LDRs for detecting
external light. Designed a robust network by connecting the lights and sensors in a mesh topology.

· Built an application using Android Studio and Firebase to monitor the system’s feedback and notify in case of malfunction.

· Prototyped a two-lane two-way highway use case during testing and observed an energy efficiency of 65%.

As part of the project the following Arduino codes were written:

1) PIR_testing.ino - For testing the PIR sensors

2) LDR_testing.ino - For testing the LDR sensors

3) Streetlighting.ino - The final working code for implementing the two-lane two-way street lighting system.
